### Fiddyfiddy Strategy

To avoid Form W-2G requirements:

- **Formula**: Max Tickets = floor($1200 / ticket_price)

### Ticket Price to Max Tickets

| $1 | 1,200 | $600 |
| $2 | 600 | $600 |

| $20 | 60 | $600 |

## 14. Troubleshooting

### Debug Endpoint

Access `/api/debug?raffleId={id}` to see raw Knack data:
- Raw field values
- Mapped field values
- Useful for field mapping issues

### Common Symptoms

#### "Login failed" but credentials are correct

1. Check user exists in Knack
2. Verify password is bcrypt hashed
3. Check user status is not "Suspended"
4. Verify `field_57` (email) format

#### Tickets not appearing in verification

1. Check ticket status is "Pending"
2. Verify raffle connection (field_91)
3. Check filters in `/api/raffles/[id]/pending-tickets`

#### Venmo links not working

1. Verify Venmo handle format (no @ in database)
2. Test on mobile (desktop may not have Venmo app)
3. Check URL encoding of special characters

#### Drawing fails

1. Verify organizer status is "Active" (not "Pending")
2. Check eligible tickets exist (Verified status)
3. Review error in browser console

#### Emails not sending

1. Verify SendGrid API key
2. Check sender email is verified in SendGrid
3. Review SendGrid activity log
4. Check spam folders

### Log Locations

| Environment | Where to Check |
|-------------|----------------|
| Local | Terminal running `npm run dev` |
| Vercel | Vercel Dashboard → Deployments → Logs |
| Knack | Knack Activity Log |

## 15. Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Email field returns HTML

**Symptom**: `player_email` shows `<a href="mailto:...">...</a>`

**Solution**: Already handled in code with `stripHtml()` function:
```javascript
const stripHtml = (str) => str?.replace?.(/<[^>]*>/g, '') || str;
```

### Issue: Currency fields return formatted strings

**Symptom**: `ticket_price` shows `"$5.00"` instead of `5`

**Solution**: Use `parseCurrency()` helper:
```javascript
function parseCurrency(value) {
  if (!value) return 0;
  if (typeof value === 'number') return value;
  const cleaned = String(value).replace(/[$,]/g, '');
  return parseFloat(cleaned) || 0;
}
```

### Issue: Connection fields return nested objects

**Symptom**: `organizer` shows `[{id: "xxx", identifier: "..."}]`

**Solution**: Extract ID from raw field:
```javascript
organizer: record.field_83_raw?.[0]?.id || record.field_83
```

### Issue: Boolean fields inconsistent

**Symptom**: `is_public` sometimes `true`, sometimes `"Yes"`

**Solution**: Handle all cases:
```javascript
is_public: record.field_73 === true || 
           record.field_73 === 'Yes' || 
           record.field_73 === 'yes'
```

### Issue: Vercel deployment fails

**Symptom**: Build error on Vercel

**Solutions**:
1. Check Root Directory setting
2. Verify all environment variables set
3. Review build logs for specific error
4. Test local build: `npm run build`

### Issue: "Cannot read property of undefined"

**Symptom**: API returns 500 error

**Solutions**:
1. Check Knack API credentials
2. Verify object/field IDs match schema
3. Add null checks in field mapping
4. Review Knack record exists
